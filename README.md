# The Laws of Human Nature Cheat Sheet

For every law the author provides an example from history, interprets and explains it and gives advice on how to use the 
law. 

- Pros: very interesting historical examples. 
- Cons: the laws are not supported by any scientific data and purely an opinion of the author.

## 1. The Law of Irrationality
   
- **Law**: often people are affected by emotions and behave irrationally without realizing it. This leads to suboptimal
actions and decisions.
- **Example**: Athenes prospered when it was led by Pericles in 400 BC. Pericles was a very rational 
man who could control his emotions. After he left the political arena Athenes started to regress.
- **Advice**: you need to control your emotions and behave rationally.

**Biases that distort our thought processes and decisions**:

- Confirmation Bias: I look at the evidence and arrive at my decisions through more or less rational processes.
- Conviction Bias: I believe in this idea so strongly. It must be true.
- Appearance Bias: I understand the people I deal with; I see them just as they are.                     
- The Group Bias: My ideas are my own. I do not listen to the group. I am not a conformist.
- The Blame Bias: I learn from my experience and mistakes.
- Superiority Bias: I'm different. I'm more rational than others, more ethical as well.

**Strategies Toward Bringing Out the Rational Self**:

- Know yourself thoroughly
- Examine your emotions to their roots
- Increase your reaction time
- Accept people as facts
- Find the optimal balance of thinking and emotion
- Love the rational

## 2. The Law of Narcissism

- **Law**: many people are narcissists i.e. focus on and admire themselves more than others. This hinders their success
when interacting with others. Narcissists can be dangerous.
- **Example**: Joseph Stalin - premier of the Soviet Union - was a very charming and influential person. He was 
also a narcissist who killed many people during his reign. 
- **Advice**: you need to transform self-love into empathy. This will make you more successful in your group.
