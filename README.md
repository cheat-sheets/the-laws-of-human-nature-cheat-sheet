# The Laws of Human Nature Cheat Sheet

For every law the author provides an example from history, interprets and explains it and gives advice on how to use the 
law. 

- Pros: very interesting historical examples. 
- Cons: the laws are not supported by any scientific data and purely an opinion of the author.

## 1. The Law of Irrationality
   
- **Law**: often people are affected by emotions and behave irrationally without realizing it. This leads to suboptimal
actions and decisions.
- **Example**: Athenes prospered when it was led by Pericles in 400 BC. Pericles was a very rational 
man who could control his emotions. After he left the political arena Athenes started to regress.
- **Advice**: you need to control your emotions and behave rationally.

**Biases that distort our thought processes and decisions**:

- Confirmation Bias: I look at the evidence and arrive at my decisions through more or less rational processes.
- Conviction Bias: I believe in this idea so strongly. It must be true.
- Appearance Bias: I understand the people I deal with; I see them just as they are.                     
- The Group Bias: My ideas are my own. I do not listen to the group. I am not a conformist.
- The Blame Bias: I learn from my experience and mistakes.
- Superiority Bias: I'm different. I'm more rational than others, more ethical as well.

**Strategies Toward Bringing Out the Rational Self**:

- Know yourself thoroughly
- Examine your emotions to their roots
- Increase your reaction time
- Accept people as facts
- Find the optimal balance of thinking and emotion
- Love the rational

## 2. The Law of Narcissism

- **Law**: many people are narcissists i.e. focus on and admire themselves more than others. This hinders their success
when interacting with others. Narcissists can be dangerous.
- **Example**: Joseph Stalin - premier of the Soviet Union - was a very charming and influential person. He was 
also a narcissist who killed many people during his reign. Leo Tolstoy - a Russian novelist - and his wife Sonya were 
both narcissists. Their relationship was complicated. Lack of empathy made the partners retreat deeper and deeper 
into their own defensive positions.                               
- **Advice**: you need to transform self-love into empathy. This will make you more successful in your group.

## 3. The Law of Role-playing

- **Law**: people tend to wear the mask that shows them off in the best possible light. 
They hide their true personality.
- **Example**: Milton Erickson - an American psychiatrist and psychologist of 20th century - was paralysed when he was  
young and became a master reader of people body language.                           
- **Advice**: you must master the body language by transforming yourself into a superior reader of men and women. At 
the same time you must learn how to present the best front and play your role to maximum effect.

**[Impression management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_management)** - a conscious or subconscious process in which people attempt to influence the perceptions 
of other people about a person, object or event. 

## 4. The Law of Compulsive Behavior

- **Law**: people never do something just once. They will inevitably repeat their bad behavior.
- **Example**: Howard Hughes Jr. - an American business magnate, investor, record-setting pilot, 
engineer, film director, and philanthropist - had a weak character starting from his childhood. He managed to disguise
it in his early career which brought him success. However it manifested later in hist life and resulted in many
failures e.g. Hughes Aircraft Company.                     
- **Advice**: train yourself to look deep within people and see their character. Always gravitate toward those 
who display signs of strength, and avoid the many toxic types out there.

## 5. The Law of Covetousness

- **Law**: people continually desire to possess what they don't have
- **Example**: Coco Chanel - a French fashion designer and business woman - became so successful not only because she
created great products but because she understood how to play with people's desires and fantasies.                     
- **Advice**: become an elusive object of desire.
